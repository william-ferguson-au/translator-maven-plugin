\n
\nSince you\'ve played it a few times now,
\nwe hope you think it\'s great too.
\n
\nIf you come across any issues or ideas,
\nlet us know so we can get right on them.

    <string name="piracy_dialog_message">Jumblee was crafted with much love
\nand care and took many months of work.
\n
\nThe problem is, that it seems that this copy of Jumblee has been pirated.
  Which means that some bastard is profiting off my hard labour, and you have a version of Jumblee that can never be improved.
\n
\nTo download a current, legitimate and FREE version of Jumblee, click on the appropriate button below.
\n
    </string>

    <string name="how_to_play_dialog_message">Jumblee is a word game where you must find as many words of four or more letters in the allotted time.
\n
\nEach word must contain the central letter exactly once, while other tiles can be used no more than once.
\n
\nYou start each game with 60 seconds and finding a new word increases that time by 20 seconds.
\n
\nThe games ends when either:
\n - Time runs out, or
\n - You give up
\n
\nScores are determined by both the percentage of words found and how quickly words are found. So find as many words as you can, as quickly as you can.
\n
\nHave fun.

    <string name="eula_dialog_message">I hate long boring legalese EULAs, so this isn\'t one. However, it\'s a still a license agreement between you and Xandar Pty Ltd for the use of Jumblee, but hopefully it\'s a bit more fun.
\n
\n
\nI lease you this app, it won\'t cost a cent.
\nBut the content is mine, it\'s only yours to rent.
\n
\nYou can give Jumblee to others, can\'t charge money.
\nYou can\'t disassemble or change it, that\'s not funny.
\n
\nI\'ll support you as best I can and charge no fees.
\nYou agree its a game. No liabilities, no warranties.
\n
\nI collect anon usage data, to make the game better.
\nYou agree to support this, as the end-user.
\n
\nJumblee shows ads, cause I\'ve got to eat.
\nRough (regional) location makes those ads great.
\n
\nYou agree to show the ads, it\'s only fair.
\nTo pay for 6 months development and loss of hair.
\n
\nI don\'t store your location, or use it for aught else.
\nIf that ever changes I promise to ask first.

    <string name="no_available_jumbles_dialog_message">There aren\'t any Jumbles available at present.
\n
\nYou\'ve really been churning through them to run out.
\nWhat\'s your percentageFound found?
\nThink you\'ll make the world qualifier\'s with that?
\n
\nAnyway, more Jumbles are being generated.
\nSo be patient and you can get back to it in a minute.
\n
\nGlad to see you\'re so keen :-)
